Dear Simon,

Please consider this email my formal application for the role of 'Product support and QA Engineer' at OMG Life.

I am an ideal candidate for this role as from working here for the last 19 months I have gained a complete understanding of the QA & testing for the various products assosciated with Autographer i.e. the device iteself, desktop and mobile apps.

Aside from these roles I have also taken the role of release manager, customer support interface, and I have helped with the Support website.

As you know I am excited by consumer electronics products and the Autographer devices, OMG Life has given me a start in what I hope will be a long and sucessful career within the industry, and I would like to remain with OMG Life for the foreseeable future.

A recent CV can be found at <http://phelm.co.uk> however you will understand that with the short notice of my appliction for this position, some details may be out of date. Let me know if there are any details that you would like to clarify with me.

Kind Regards,
