This has been a fantastic experience as it is a pioneering product. I am currently responsible for the quality and release of the company's softare (Windows, OSX, iOS & Android apps), and the device firmware. This has been invaluable experience, I am now looking for new experiences where I can further develop my skills and knowledge of software engineering, which I am also studying in my own time.",
